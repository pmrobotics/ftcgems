Improving XT30 power connections
================================

.. container:: pmslide

   Male XT30 connection on REV Control Hubs can become compressed

   Results in intermittent power connections (control hub reboots)

   Solution:

   * Provide power to both XT30 ports
   * Use WAGO lever-nuts as power distribution block
   * Use high-quality XT30 pigtail cables
