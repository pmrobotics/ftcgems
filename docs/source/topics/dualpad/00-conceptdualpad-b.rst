Running ConceptDualPad 
======================

.. container:: pmslide

   * | Pressing the "b" button on a gamepad 
     | 1. switches the bToggle variable between "off" and "on"
     | 2. keeps a count of the number of times the "b" button is pressed

   * | The left_bumper acts as a "shift" key.  
     | Holding down the left_bumper and "b" at the same time registers 
       as "gpad.shift.b" instead of "gpad.b"

   * If two gamepads are connected, pressing "b" on either gamepad works
     the same.
