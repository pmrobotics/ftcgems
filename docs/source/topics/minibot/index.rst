The Minibot is a simple mecanum drive robot used for topics and demonstrations.  It's basically a goBILDA Strafer Chassis Kit with shorter channels and the rear motors turned to a vertical orientation.  A few custom 3D-printed parts hold a REV Control Hub, REV Expansion Hub, battery, power switch, and some quick-release-mount attachments.
